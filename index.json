Georgian and Ukrainian right-wingers and nationalist put confidence in these promises and started to feel strong - removing minority protection regulations for Russians living in their countries. Russia took action in South-Ossetia in Georgia in 2008 and in Crimea in Ukraine in 2014. In neither case Nato or the US were able to counter. In 2022 with the full Russian occupation of Ukraine going on Nato and the US once more pull back.\nNato\u0026rsquo;s general secretary Jens Stoltenberg keeps talking: \u0026lsquo;Every centimeter of Nato soil will be defended\u0026rsquo; But is this trustworthy?\nSome of my Norwegian friends are raising the prospect of Russian occupation of Norwegian teritory: - Finnmark and The Svalbard Islands - Russia creating another \u0026lsquo;Buffer Zone\u0026rsquo; towards Nato. Norwegian forces on their own will not be able to withstand. Norwegian defense policy is based on one card - Nato coming to the rescue. A creeping doubt has entered from Ukraine: can we really rely on Nato?\nCan we still rely on Nato?\nThe US is the core strength of Nato. When Norway relies on Nato it is basically the US that delivers the guarantee. In the US priorities are shifting. Europe is no longer the major strategic interest for the US. As John Mearsheimer puts it:\n America\u0026rsquo;s Post-2000 strategic interests are: 1) Western Hemisphere 2) Asia 3) Persian Gulf and 4) Europe.\n The US do not want to risk a military confrontation with Russia in Europe - neither over Geogia, nor over Ukraine, nor over \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;.\nYou can fill in what you think. Will the US confront Russia over Finnmark? Svalbard? Estland? Latvia? Litauen?\nThe hard fact is that Europe\u0026rsquo;s security arrangement has to be redesigned, taking into account the new US disinterest as well as the Russian\u0026rsquo;s need for keeping Nato at a distance.\nThe Buchurest-declaration was a severe mistake. Nato is not able to sustain its expansionism - creating tradegies in Georgia and Ukraine. Europe can no longer hide under the US umbrella. Russia is a rising super-power that can no longer be ignored.\nIf Europe wants to stand up against Putin\u0026rsquo;s atrocities in Ukraine it will have to do so on her own.

You can burn oil and gas at any time, but the wind and sun are erratic sources. To ensure continous supply energy storage is required. For short-duration energy storage batteries are the core option and among batteries lithium-ion is the dominant technology of today.\nLithium is mostly produced in mines in Australia, Chile and China. Europe has no lithium production of it\u0026rsquo;s own. The EU sees that as a strategic deficit - and are eagerly wanting some supply\u0026rsquo;s of its own.\nUnhappy Portugal hit \u0026hellip; Portugal has some lithium ore sites, and a British mining company has acquired the rights to develop the mine.

The waters are rich in sardines, barracuda and grouper, caught by local fishermen who produce 70% of the fish for the domestic market.\nThe $55m deal struck by the government of Sierra Leone with China to build an industrial fishing harbour on 100 hectares (250 acres) of beach and protected rainforest has been criticised as “a catastrophic human and ecological disaster” by conservationists, landowners and rights groups.\nThe full store [here](Guardian\nUnhappy Norway hit \u0026hellip; Norway has been a latecomer to wind-power exploitation.

Lars Calmfors in DN 22 feb 2021. The notice is triggered by his involvement in a Norwegian Green Paper Commision on Labour and Income Policy. NOU 2019:7. The Commision shouldpropose new measures to increase labour participation in Norway.\nInternationally the Nordic (sometimes only Scandinavian) countries are mostly treated as fairly much of the same under the heading of \u0026lsquo;The Nordic Model\u0026rsquo;. This article however points to the particularities of Norway compared to Sweden.\nCalmfors\u0026rsquo;s main point is that Norway will not be able to tackle both decreasing oil returns and high levels of health-related labour market absense when at the same time the population is quickly aging.\nAs expected the economists look to \u0026lsquo;increased labour market participation\u0026rsquo; as the \u0026lsquo;key factor\u0026rsquo; to tackle the problems Norway is now fronting. (This was in their mandate).\nCompared to Sweden the percentage of people living on health-related social contributions are much higher in Norway (17 pct around the double of Sweden). Calmfors interprets this figure av \u0026lsquo;medicalization of labour market problems\u0026rsquo; - which might for sure be true.\nWhen discussing what to do about this situation the differences to Sweden come to the surface. The Nowegian way is quite more corporativistic than what could happen in Sweden. After receiving expert proposals from the economists the Commision is enlarged with participants from Employers and Labour Unions plus from Government. Together they are charged with finding (for all) acceptable ways forwards.\nThis way of working together (3-party co-operation) to me lies at the heart of the \u0026lsquo;Nordic Model\u0026rsquo;, so I am a bit surprised by learning from Calmfors that this is not the way it works in Sweden? May be the \u0026lsquo;Norwegian Model\u0026rsquo; is not the same as the \u0026lsquo;Nordic Model\u0026rsquo; after all? Calmfors\u0026rsquo;s conclusion is that this cooperative mode paired with strong egalitarian drives will create great obstacles for getting more people involved on the labour market.\nMay be he is right in this. But to me it sounds like an argument to skip the core of the \u0026lsquo;Norwegian Model\u0026rsquo; - for something more neo-liberalistic? That would be out of date. The Reagan-Thatcher era is long gone - if not yet among mainstream economists.\nHowever, to my mind Norway faces problems at the end of the oil age that calls for looking much more broadly into the strategy of economic transition for the coming decades. Strikingly the issue of greening the economy is out of focus for this commision. But let me first take a look at the workings of the \u0026lsquo;Norwegian Model\u0026rsquo; - which has been in operation from the mid 1930s up till now - and may be longer?\nThe Norwegian Way An interesting analysis of the \u0026lsquo;Scandinavian Model\u0026rsquo; is found in Barth 2014 (pdf)\nThe conclusion of this work is as follows (my emphasis):\n Why has the Scandinavian model worked so well? And, why have its institutions and policies survived, in spite of changing economic and political circumstances? Our answer to both questions is that there is a strong complementarity between the Scandinavian non-market institutions and capitalist dynamics.\n  Our paper emphasizes the political–economic equilibrium between three sets of mechanisms. Encompassing organizations in the labor market follow a policy of wage coordination and wage compression, with a strong preference for full employment in central bargaining and microeconomic efficiency in local bargaining. Wage compression leads to a higher pace of creative destruction and further wage compression with an increasing average wage. More wage equality and higher average wages fuel the political support for welfare spending. There might even be a feedback from public welfare policies to productivity rise and further wage compression. This complementarity explains why the same outcomes—efficiency and a high level of equality—could not have been achieved by redistribution through the political system alone. This political-economic equilibrium path has benefitted from consistent policies that have supplemented market forces. Active labor market programs and moderations on employment protection have been important policies to facilitate structural change and reallocation of labor without excessive wage differentials.\n  A similar concern for consistency is evident from the extensive use of ‘work-fare’ policies, which are used in Denmark, Norway and Sweden to ensure that work pays in the presence of generous welfare benefits. High employment reduces the cost of a generous benefit system and increases the tax base. Active job search or qualification efforts are for example required in order to obtain unemployment benefits.\n  In sum, the complementarity between the non-market institutions and capitalist investments help explain why the main institutions and policies have survived over 80 years. The gains are spread widely across groups. There are many winners and few losers. Both low paid groups and employers are clear winners as wage compression and rising profits are two sides of the same coin. High skilled workers are potential losers. But also high skilled workers may gain from wage moderation, as the average productivity goes up.\n  The stability of the Scandinavian model can in part be explained by the good performance, and the good performance must have been helped by the stability of the model. The key is that both depend on the egalitarian aspects of the Scandinavian model that share the gains of good performance on almost all groups. Since the interactions be- tween wage coordination, investments, and welfare spending all strengthen the egalitarian aspects of the model, it would not be possible to achieve the same egalitarian results by redistribution through the welfare state only.\n So - the \u0026lsquo;Nordic / Scandinavian / Norwegian Model\u0026rsquo; turns out to be just a smart way to let capitalism evolve. And it has worked well - on that premise - so far.\nThe model\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;golden age\u0026rsquo; was before 1980. But the neoliberal era - from 1980 onwards has created some dilemmas- which might be read in the constant decline of the labour parties in all the Nordic countries during the last couple of decades.\nThe alliance between Labour and Capital was based on mutual benefits: Labour Organizations accepted wage restraints as long as capitalist continued investing in project that created increade number of jobs. However in the 1980\u0026rsquo;s this closed loop was broken be globalization. Capitalist\u0026rsquo;s started putting the money into China and other developing countries instead of investing at home. Labour is no longer on the winning side of the play. The gains are no longer as widely spread across groups. As in other countries there is a rising precariate.\nThis has been most visible in the other Nordic countries - for Norway the oil money came in between as a saving angel - allowing for such \u0026lsquo;economic diseases\u0026rsquo; as 17% health-related social contributions to people not participating in the labour market. Thus, the coming end of the oil era put Norway up for greater challenges than the other Nordic countries, as Calmfors rightly explained.\nTo green the economy while at the same time get out of \u0026lsquo;oil addiction\u0026rsquo; is really a double challenge.\nTo find the way forwards one will need a lot more than main-stream econmic thinking a la Calmfors.\nA starting point could be an \u0026lsquo;evolutionary economics\u0026rsquo; approach. Interesting extension in the understanding of how the \u0026lsquo;Norwegian Model\u0026rsquo; works come from Wlison and Hessen (2015). (My emphasis)\n The success of the so-called “Nordic Model” is commonly attributed to factors such as income equality, a high level of trust, high willingness to pay tax, which is tightly coupled to strong social security (health, education), a blend of governmental regulations and capitalism, and cultural homogeneity. These and other factors are important, but we think that viewing them through an evolutionary lens is likely to shed light on why they are important. Our hypothesis is that Norway functions well as a nation because it has successfully managed to scale up the social control mechanisms that operate spontaneously in village-sized groups. Income equality, trust, and the other factors attributed to Norway’s success emanate from the social control mechanisms.\n ","permalink":"https://dyrehaugen.github.io/rde/posts/2021-02-26-the-case-of-norway/","summary":"Nordic differences My Swedish friend Torbjörn just sent me a paper clip containing a notice of a Swedish economics professor commenting on the economic situation in Norway.

Of particular interest I found the contribution of Antoinette Schoar (MIT Sloan) - as refered by Bruegel:\nAntoinette Schoar looks at the financial market, argues that the rapid growth of new digital technologies has created a market dynamic, where many institutions outside the central bank system might soon have much more comprehensive, more accurate and also more timely information than the regulators.","title":"Hypergranular Macroeconomics"},{"content":"Mainstream economics failure to \u0026lsquo;see the crisis coming\u0026rsquo; in 2008 is broadly regarded as a deficiency of the theory. However, Paul Krugman now argues that the theory was - and is - \u0026lsquo;good enough for government\u0026rsquo;. The failure of 2008 was not in the theory, but rather in deficient data collection. Macroeconomists \u0026ldquo;overlooked\u0026rdquo; the institutional changes in the financial sector and did not record appropriate data.\nThe \u0026ldquo;New Keynesians\u0026rdquo; - i.e. Krugman\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Saltwater School\u0026rsquo; based at MIT and Harvard - took up the challenge by dust[ing] off their old sticky-price models from the 1950s and 1960s, which told them three things:\n Very large budget deficits would not drive up near-zero interest rates. Even large increases in the monetary base would not lead to high inflation, or even to corresponding increases in broader monetary aggregates. There would be a positive national income multiplier, almost surely greater than one, from changes in government spending and taxation.  Krugman argues that these propositions made the case for budget deficits in the aftermath of the collapse of 2008 which worked “remarkably well.” This New Keynesian policy was a succes - in contrast to the more inflexible responses promoted by the \u0026lsquo;Freshwater - Chicago School\u0026rsquo;.\nHowever, fiscal expansion was soon replaced by austerity.\nKrugman\u0026rsquo;s version is not taken at face value by Robert Skidelsky who argues that when Keynes was briefly exhumed for six months in 2008-2009, it was for political, not intellectual, reasons. Because the New Keynesian models did not offer a sufficient basis for maintaining Keynesian policies once the economic emergency had been overcome, they were quickly abandoned.\nThe problem for New Keynesian macroeconomists is that they fail to acknowledge radical uncertainty in their models, leaving them without any theory of what to do in good times in order to avoid the bad times. Their focus on nominal wage and price rigidities implies that if these factors were absent, equilibrium would readily be achieved. They regard the financial sector as neutral, not as fundamental.\nWithout acknowledgement of uncertainty, saltwater economics is bound to collapse into its freshwater counterpart. New Keynesian “tweaking” will create limited political space for intervention, but not nearly enough to do a proper job. So Krugman’s argument, while provocative, is certainly not conclusive. Macroeconomics still needs to come up with a big new idea.\nSkidelsky\nKrugman\n","permalink":"https://dyrehaugen.github.io/rde/posts/2018-01-25-krugmans-explanations/","summary":"Mainstream economics failure to \u0026lsquo;see the crisis coming\u0026rsquo; in 2008 is broadly regarded as a deficiency of the theory.
